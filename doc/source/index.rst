Segmentation Evaluation using segeval
*************************************

This package is a collection of metrics and a `command-line interface <#commandline-usage>`_ for evaluating segmentation.  A variety of metrics are provided, including:

* Segmentation Similarity (S) [FournierInkpen2012]_;
* WindowDiff;
* Pk; and others.

Additionally, inter-coder agreement coefficients that are based upon S for both 2 and more coders are provided, including:

* Kappa; and
* Pi.

If you have any suggestions, problems, or difficulties, please `log an issue <https://github.com/cfournie/segmentation.evaluation/issues>`_, or `contact me <http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/about/>`_. For a roadmap of planned features and future work see my `page on SegEval <http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/software/>`_.

Installation
============

Requirements:

* `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/download/>`_
* Recommended: `setuptools0.6c11 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ (either is required to effortlessly install)


Mac OSX and Linux
-----------------

Verifying Requirements
++++++++++++++++++++++

First let's verify that you have all of the requirements setup. Let's check for the right version of python.  Open up your terminal and enter::

  which python

It should output some string that contains the number ``2.7`` in it, much like::
  
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python

Now type::

  python --version

You should see a version string returned that contains the number ``2.7`` in it, much like::

  Python 2.7.3

Now let's try to see whether ``setuptools`` is installed; type::

  which easy_install

It should return a path that matches (except for the text after ``/bin/``) the output of the earlier call to ``which python``::

  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/easy_install


Installing
++++++++++

After installing the required packages, open up your terminal and enter::
  
  sudo easy_install segeval

Or, if you are using pip, open up your terminal and enter::
  
  sudo pip segeval

To verify that it worked, type::

  python -m segeval

It should complain by saying::

  usage: segeval [-h] {pi,k,b,f,r,p,pr,s,pk,wd,wpr} ...
  segeval: error: too few arguments

If that worked, then you're done; enjoy!


Windows

Verifying Requirements
++++++++++++++++++++++

First let's verify that you have all of the requirements setup. Let's check for the right version of python.  Open up your terminal and enter::

  python --version

You should see a version string returned that contains the number ``2.7`` in it, much like::

  Python 2.7.3


Installing
++++++++++

Open up a command prompt and run::

  easy_install segeval

Or, if you are using pip, open up your terminal and enter::
  
  sudo pip segeval

To verify that it worked, type::

  python -m segeval

It should complain by saying::

  usage: segeval [-h] {pi,k,b,f,r,p,pr,s,pk,wd,wpr} ...
  segeval: error: too few arguments

If that worked, then you're done; enjoy!


Source Install
--------------

To install from source, `download or clone the source code repository from github <https://github.com/cfournie/segmentation.evaluation>`_, extract it, and navigate to the ``src/python/main`` directory and run::
  
  python setup.py install

To verify that it worked, type::

  python -m segeval

It should complain by saying::

  usage: segeval [-h] {pi,k,b,f,r,p,pr,s,pk,wd,wpr} ...
  segeval: error: too few arguments

If that worked, then you're done; enjoy!


.. _commandline-usage:

Commandline usage
=================

From a terminal, use::

  python -m segeval -h

This will present you with the available options::

  usage: segeval [-h] {pi,k,b,f,r,p,pr,s,pk,wd,wpr} ...

  A discourse segmentation evaluation utility.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  metric:
    Calculates a specified segmentation evaluation metric upon provided data

    {pi,k,b,f,r,p,pr,s,pk,wd,wpr}
                          Available metrics
      pi                  S-based Fleiss' Multi Pi
      k                   S-based Fleiss' Multi Kappa
      b                   S-based Artstein and Poesio's (2008) Bias
      f                   Pairwise Mean F_beta Measure
      r                   Pairwise Mean Recall
      p                   Pairwise Mean Precision
      pr                  Pairwise Mean Percentage
      s                   Mean S
      pk                  Mean Pk
      wd                  Mean WindowDiff
      wpr                 Mean WinPR

From here, you can ask for more detailed help for a specific metric, such as ``S``::

  python -m segeval s -h

It's usage has the following options::

  usage: segeval s [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-f {tsv,json}] [-d DELIMITER] [-n N]
                   [-wt WT] [-ws WS] [-te TE] [-de]
                   input

  positional arguments:
    input                 Input file or directory

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                          Output file or directory. If not specified, a summary
                          or results is printed to the console.
    -f {tsv,json}, --format {tsv,json}
                          Input file format; default is json
    -d DELIMITER, --delimiter DELIMITER
                          Delimiting character for input TSV files; ignored if
                          JSON is specified, default is a tab character
    -n N                  The maximum number of PBs that boundaries can span to
                          be considered transpositions (n<2 means no
                          transpositions); default is 2.
    -wt WT                Weight, 0 <= wt <= 1, to scale transposition error by;
                          default is 1 (no scaling).
    -ws WS                Weight, 0 <= wt <= 1, to scale substitution error by;
                          default is 1 (no scaling).
    -te TE                Scale transpositions by their size and the number of
                          boundaries the span; True by default
    -de, --detailed       When specifying an output TSV file, specify this to
                          obtain a detailed error breakdown per edit

There are two modes of output:

* Screen output (default); and
* TSV (Tab Separated Values) file output (enabled by specifying an output file using ``-o OUTPUT``)

Screen outputis very minimal, but will often give you the quick values that you need.  The TSV output is meant for being passed into `R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_, or another statistical package, and contains detailed values per pair of coders/item.

For screen output, if you have some `sample data <https://github.com/cfournie/segmentation.corpora>`_, you can run::

  python -m segeval s hearst1997.json 

Which produces::

  S 
    mean  = 0.7619047619047619047619047619
    std = 0.07055015423823358837798727192
    var = 0.004977324263038548752834467119
    stderr  = 0.01539530581369118988034410932


Input Data Formats
==================

SegEval reads data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or TSV (Tab Separated Values) formats as specified in the `Segmentation Representation Specifcation Version 0.1 <http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/publications/pdf/fournier_segeval_spec_2012.pdf>`_ (PDF).
