SegEval v1.1 beta
=================

This package is a collection of metrics and a [command-line interface](http://packages.python.org/segeval/#commandline-usage) for evaluating segmentation. A variety of metrics are provided, including: **Segmentation Similarity (S)** [(Fournier and Inkpen, 2012)](http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/publications/#segmentation); **WindowDiff**; **Pk**; and others.

Additionally, inter-coder agreement coefficients that are based upon S for both 2 and more coders are provided, including: **Kappa**; and **Pi**.

For more details, see the [manual](http://packages.python.org/segeval/).
