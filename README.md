SegEval v1.0 beta
=================

This package is a collection of metrics and a [command-line interface](http://packages.python.org/segeval/#commandline-usage) for evaluating segmentation. A variety of metrics are provided, including:

- Segmentation Similarity (S) [(Fournier and Inkpen, 2012)](http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/publications/#segmentation);
- WindowDiff;
- Pk; and others.

Additionally, inter-coder agreement coefficients that are based upon S for both 2 and more coders are provided, including:

- Kappa; and
- Pi.

For more details, see the manual at http://packages.python.org/segeval/
