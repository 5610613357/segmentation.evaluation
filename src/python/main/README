This package is a collection of metrics and a command-line interface for
evaluating segmentation. A variety of metrics are provided, including:
Segmentation Similarity (S) (`Fournier and Inkpen 2012
<http://localhost/publications/pdf/fournier_inkpen_2012.pdf>`_); WindowDiff;
Pk; and others.

Additionally, inter-coder agreement coefficients that are based upon S for
both 2 and more coders are provided, including: Kappa; an Pi.
