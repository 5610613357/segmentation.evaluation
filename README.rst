        :target: https://travis-ci.org/cfournie/segmentation.evaluation


SegEval is a BSD Licensed library for evaluating text segmentation.
Text segmentation is the task of splitting up text by placing boundaries within it according to some subjective criterion.
SegEval provides a variety of comparison methods and inter-coder agreement coefficients for segmentation as both APIs and a `CLI <http://packages.python.org/segeval/#commandline-usage>`_.

Some metrics provided include: **Boundary Similarity (B)** `(Fournier, 2013) <http://nlp.chrisfournier.ca/publications/#mascthesis>`_; **Segmentation Similarity (S)** `(Fournier and Inkpen, 2012) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2847>`_; **WindowDiff**; **Pk**; and others.

Additionally, inter-coder agreement coefficients that are based upon B for both 2 and more coders are provided, including: **Kappa**; and **Pi**.

For more details, see the `manual <http://packages.python.org/segeval/>`_.


Installation
------------

Requires `Python 2.7+ <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/>`_; to install segeval, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install segeval

Or, run ``git clone`` and ``make install``.



Testing
-------

To compile and test, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

Or, for output of test coverage, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make coverage
